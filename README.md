##  Who am I? 🤔     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2663e976-2a38-47cc-bcb5-536ab5bcc6e0)

I am a fourth-year Software Engineering student who enjoys taking on new challenges and the learning opportunities they bring. 
I am currently situated in The Hague, Netherlands, but I originally come from Jamaica and Aruba. I went to the Netherlands 
for a chance at getting a better opportunity for my education. 
As for other things about me, I enjoy working out, traveling, and also trying new foods.

## What am I looking for? 🔎
I am currently interested in backend development, specifically in GoLang, Java, or C#. While sharpening my skills in backend development is a goal of mine, Full-stack development is also one of my passions.
